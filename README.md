# bitfl-kivy
Restarted BITFL work using the Kivy framework

## How to run

### Windows

You'll need to install [Kivy for Windows](http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html).  This goes through all of the steps to actually run the main.py file.

### Mac OSX

Follow the [Kivy for Mac OSX instructions](http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-macosx.html) to get the Kivy.app application loaded.  You can then drag main.py onto Kivy.app, or go to a terminal window and run "kivy main.py".

### Linux

[Kivy on Linux](http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html#ubuntu-11-10-or-newer) has most instructions that you'll need to get Kivy going.  Once Kivy is on your system in the python library path, you can just run "python main.py".

### Android

The bin/ directory of this repository contains built APK files that can be loaded directly onto your Android device.  

### iOS

Coming soon, as soon as I have an iOS to actually test with.  If you have one and would like to test, let me know!
